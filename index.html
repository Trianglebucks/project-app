              have retentive memory xD joke. Anyways, we've going through a lot
              and there's definitely a lot more ahead of us, but I'm sure these
              things are nothing for us as God always has a plan. As always,
              your eyes are like smoldering coals, merciless as they burn my
              soul in the most delightful way. Love you."
